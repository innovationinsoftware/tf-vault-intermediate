2. Log in with your HashiCorp account
3. Select your organization from the organization list

### Step 2: Create a Project

1. Click **Projects** in the navigation
2. Click **+ Create project**
3. Enter the following details:
   - **Project name**: `vault-lab-{your-initials}` (e.g., `vault-lab-js`)
   - **Project description**: `HCP Vault setup and configuration lab`
4. Click **Create project**

### Step 3: Deploy Vault Cluster

1. From the project overview page, click **Vault Dedicated - Get started with Vault Dedicated**
2. On the Vault overview page, click **Create cluster** under **Start from scratch**
3. Select your preferred cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
4. Configure the cluster settings:
   - **Vault tier**: Development
   - **Cluster size**: Extra Small
   - **Network ID**: `hvn-{your-initials}` (e.g., `hvn-js`)
   - **Region**: Accept default
   - **CIDR block**: Accept default
5. Under **Basics**, set the **Cluster ID** to `vault-lab-cluster-{your-initials}` (e.g., `vault-lab-cluster-js`)
6. Under **Templates**, select **Start from scratch**
7. Click **Create cluster**

### Step 4: Wait for Cluster Initialization

The cluster creation process typically takes 5-10 minutes. You can monitor the progress on the cluster overview page.

## Part 3: Accessing Your HCP Vault Cluster

### Security Considerations

When an HCP Vault Dedicated cluster has **public** access enabled, you can connect to Vault from any internet-connected device. If your use case requires public access, we recommend configuring the **IP allow list** to limit which IPv4 public IP addresses or CIDR ranges can connect to Vault.

When the HCP Vault Dedicated cluster has **private** access enabled, you will need to access the cluster from a connected cloud provider such as AWS with a VPC peering connection, an AWS transit gateway connection, or Azure with an Azure Virtual Network peering connection. For the purposes of this tutorial, your cluster should have public access enabled.

### Method 1: Web UI Access

1. From the **Overview** page, click **Generate token** in the **New admin token** card
2. Click **Copy** to copy the new token to your clipboard
3. Click **Launch web UI**
4. When the Vault UI launches in a new tab/window, enter the token in the **Token** field
5. Click **Sign In**

Notice that your current namespace is `admin/`.

<!-- ### Method 2: CLI Access

**Prerequisite:** Install Vault CLI by following the [Install Vault guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/install)

1. Under **Quick actions**, click **Public** Cluster URL
2. In a terminal, set the `VAULT_ADDR` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export VAULT_ADDR=<Public_Cluster_URL>
   ```
3. Verify your connectivity to the Vault cluster:
   ```bash
   vault status
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   Key                      Value
   ---                      -----
   Recovery Seal Type       shamir
   Initialized              true
   Sealed                   false
   Total Recovery Shares    1
   Threshold                1
   Version                  1.6.0+ent
   Storage Type             raft
   ```
4. Return to the **Overview** page and click **Generate token**
5. Copy the **Admin Token**
6. Return to the terminal and log in with Vault:
   ```bash
   vault login
   Token (will be hidden): <token>
   ```
7. View the current token configuration:
   ```bash
   vault token lookup
   ```
   Notice that `namespace_path` is `admin/`. This indicates that you are logged into the `admin` namespace.
8. Set the `VAULT_NAMESPACE` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export VAULT_NAMESPACE="admin"
   ```

### Method 3: API Access with cURL

**Prerequisite:** Install `jq` for JSON processing

1. Under **Quick actions**, click the **Public** Cluster URL
2. In a terminal, set the `VAULT_ADDR` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export VAULT_ADDR=<Public_Cluster_URL>
   ```
3. Return to the **Overview** page and click **Generate token**
4. Copy the **Admin Token**
5. Set the `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export VAULT_TOKEN=<token>
   ```
6. Verify connectivity using one of these methods:

   **Option 1:** Specify the target namespace in the `X-Vault-Namespace` header:
   ```bash
   curl --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" \
      --header "X-Vault-Namespace: admin" \
      $VAULT_ADDR/v1/auth/token/lookup-self | jq -r ".data"
   ```

   **Option 2:** Use environment variable for namespace:
   ```bash
   export VAULT_NAMESPACE=admin
   curl --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" \
      --header "X-Vault-Namespace: $VAULT_NAMESPACE" \
      $VAULT_ADDR/v1/auth/token/lookup-self | jq -r ".data"
   ```

   **Option 3:** Prepend the API endpoint with namespace:
   ```bash
   curl --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" \
      $VAULT_ADDR/v1/admin/auth/token/lookup-self | jq -r ".data"
   ``` -->

## Part 4: Configuring HCP Vault

## Part 1: Basic Vault Operations

### Step 1: Enable KV Secrets Engine

1. In the Vault UI, navigate to **Secrets** â†’ **Enable new engine**
2. Select **KV** (Key-Value) from the list
3. Configure the KV engine:
   - **Path**: `kv-{your-initials}` (e.g., `kv-js`)
   - **Everything else**: Accept defaults
4. Click **Enable Engine**

### Step 2: Store AWS Credentials

1. Navigate to the **kv-{your-initials}** engine
2. Click **Create secret**
3. Create a secret for AWS credentials:
   - **Path**: `aws/credentials`
   - **Key**: `access_key_id`
   - **Value**: Your AWS access key
4. Click **Save**
5. Create another secret:
   - **Path**: `aws/credentials`
   - **Key**: `secret_access_key`
   - **Value**: Your AWS secret key
6. Click **Save**

## Part 7: Integration with HCP Terraform

### Step 1: Get Vault Cluster URL

1. In HCP, navigate to your Vault cluster overview
2. Go to the **Overview** page
3. In the **Quick actions** pane, click **Public** Cluster URL
4. Copy the URL (it will look like: `https://vault-cluster-xxxxx.region.hashicorp.cloud`)

### Step 2: Add Vault Provider Configuration

In your existing `learn-terraform-variables` repository, update the `main.tf` file:

First, add Vault to the `required_providers` block (around line 8):

```hcl
# Update the existing required_providers block in main.tf
required_providers {
  aws = {
    source = "hashicorp/aws"
    version = "~> 3.76.0"
  }
  vault = {
    source  = "hashicorp/vault"
    version = "~> 4.0"
  }
}
```

Then, update the existing Vault provider block (around line 20):

```hcl
# Update the existing provider "vault" block in main.tf
provider "vault" {
  address = "https://your-actual-vault-cluster-url"  # Replace with your cluster URL
  token   = var.vault_token
}
```

Add the vault_token variable to `variables.tf`:

```hcl
# Add to variables.tf
variable "vault_token" {
  description = "Vault admin token"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}
```

### Step 3: Use AWS Credentials from Vault

Add the following to your `main.tf` file to retrieve AWS credentials from Vault:

```hcl
# Add this data source to main.tf (after the provider blocks, around line 25)
data "vault_kv_secret_v2" "aws_creds" {
  mount = "kv-{your-initials}"
  name  = "aws/credentials"
}

# Update the existing provider "aws" block in main.tf (around line 17)
provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-west-1"  # Keep existing region
  access_key = data.vault_kv_secret_v2.aws_creds.data["access_key_id"]
  secret_key = data.vault_kv_secret_v2.aws_creds.data["secret_access_key"]
}
```

### Step 4: Get Vault Token

1. In your HCP Vault cluster, navigate to the **Overview** page
2. In the **Quick actions** pane, click **Generate token**
3. Copy the generated admin token (you'll need this for Terraform access)

### Step 5: Update HCP Terraform Workspace Variables

1. In your existing HCP Terraform workspace for `learn-terraform-variables` (already connected via VCS)
2. Go to the **Variables** page
3. Remove any existing AWS credential variables (like `aws_access_key_id`, `aws_secret_access_key`)
4. Add a new variable:
   - **Key**: `vault_token`
   - **Value**: Paste the Vault admin token you generated
   - **Sensitive**: Check this box
5. Save the variable

### Step 6: Deploy with HCP Terraform

1. Commit and push your changes to trigger a new run via VCS integration
