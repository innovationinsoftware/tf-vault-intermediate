## Part 3: Accessing Your HCP Vault Cluster

### Security Considerations

When an HCP Vault Dedicated cluster has **public** access enabled, you can connect to Vault from any internet-connected device. If your use case requires public access, we recommend configuring the **IP allow list** to limit which IPv4 public IP addresses or CIDR ranges can connect to Vault.

When the HCP Vault Dedicated cluster has **private** access enabled, you will need to access the cluster from a connected cloud provider such as AWS with a VPC peering connection, an AWS transit gateway connection, or Azure with an Azure Virtual Network peering connection. For the purposes of this tutorial, your cluster should have public access enabled.

### Method 1: Web UI Access

1. From the **Overview** page, click **Generate token** in the **New admin token** card
2. Click **Copy** to copy the new token to your clipboard
3. Click **Launch web UI**
4. When the Vault UI launches in a new tab/window, enter the token in the **Token** field
5. Click **Sign In**

Notice that your current namespace is `admin/`.

### Method 2: CLI Access

**Prerequisite:** Install Vault CLI by following the [Install Vault guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/install)

1. Under **Quick actions**, click **Public** Cluster URL
2. In a terminal, set the `VAULT_ADDR` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export VAULT_ADDR=<Public_Cluster_URL>
   ```
3. Verify your connectivity to the Vault cluster:
   ```bash
   vault status
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   Key                      Value
   ---                      -----
   Recovery Seal Type       shamir
   Initialized              true
   Sealed                   false
   Total Recovery Shares    1
   Threshold                1
   Version                  1.6.0+ent
   Storage Type             raft
   ```
4. Return to the **Overview** page and click **Generate token**
5. Copy the **Admin Token**
6. Return to the terminal and log in with Vault:
   ```bash
   vault login
   Token (will be hidden): <token>
   ```
7. View the current token configuration:
   ```bash
   vault token lookup
   ```
   Notice that `namespace_path` is `admin/`. This indicates that you are logged into the `admin` namespace.
8. Set the `VAULT_NAMESPACE` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export VAULT_NAMESPACE="admin"
   ```

### Method 3: API Access with cURL

**Prerequisite:** Install `jq` for JSON processing

1. Under **Quick actions**, click the **Public** Cluster URL
2. In a terminal, set the `VAULT_ADDR` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export VAULT_ADDR=<Public_Cluster_URL>
   ```
3. Return to the **Overview** page and click **Generate token**
4. Copy the **Admin Token**
5. Set the `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export VAULT_TOKEN=<token>
   ```
6. Verify connectivity using one of these methods:

   **Option 1:** Specify the target namespace in the `X-Vault-Namespace` header:
   ```bash
   curl --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" \
      --header "X-Vault-Namespace: admin" \
      $VAULT_ADDR/v1/auth/token/lookup-self | jq -r ".data"
   ```

   **Option 2:** Use environment variable for namespace:
   ```bash
   export VAULT_NAMESPACE=admin
   curl --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" \
      --header "X-Vault-Namespace: $VAULT_NAMESPACE" \
      $VAULT_ADDR/v1/auth/token/lookup-self | jq -r ".data"
   ```

   **Option 3:** Prepend the API endpoint with namespace:
   ```bash
   curl --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" \
      $VAULT_ADDR/v1/admin/auth/token/lookup-self | jq -r ".data"
   ```
